I\u2019ve always been searching for the optimal way to sort through the bajillion things I have to do and remain productive.\r\n\r\nThis all started when, as a programmer, I realized that I had the power to automate the tasks that I found repetitive in my digital life. I would write scripts, for example, to do things like organize my photos, clean up my music library, and back up my data. Over the years, I\u2019ve developed my own homegrown approach to task management, which has included a couple of attempts at writing a command-line tool to manage my tasks in a way that\u2019s in line with my approach. Then, recently, I discovered that there is already a robust command-line tool that does exactly what I need.\r\n\r\nThat tool is Taskwarrior. But before I get into it, here\u2019s a brief dive into the journey that led me to using it.",

Unfortunately, due to mathematical intractability of most Bayesian models, the reader is only shown simple, artificial examples. This can leave the user with a so-what feeling about Bayesian inference. In fact, this was the author's own prior opinion.",

Personally I find it very helpful to break things down in terms of the usual error terms: Bayes error (how much error is there in the best possible classifier), approximation error (how much do you pay for restricting to some hypothesis class), estimation error (how much do you pay because you only have finite samples), optimization error (how much do you pay because you didn't find a global optimum to your optimization problem). I've generally found that trying to isolate errors to one of these pieces, and then debugging that piece in particular (eg., pick a better optimizer versus pick a better hypothesis class) has been useful.",

    "extended": "I come from the Cambridge machine learning group. More than once I heard people referring to us as \"the most Bayesian machine learning group in the world\". I mean, we do work with probabilistic models and uncertainty on a daily basis. Maybe that's why it felt so weird playing with those deep learning models (I know, joining the party very late). You see, I spent the last several years working mostly with Gaussian processes, modelling probability distributions over functions. I'm used to uncertainty bounds for decision making, in a similar way many biologists rely on model uncertainty to analyse their data. Working with point estimates alone felt weird to me. I couldn't tell whether the new model I was playing with was making sensible predictions or just guessing at random. I'm certain you've come across this problem yourself, either analysing data or solving some tasks, where you wished you could tell whether your model is certain about its output, asking yourself \"maybe I need to use more diverse data? or perhaps change the model?\". Most deep learning tools operate in a very different setting to the probabilistic models which possess this invaluable uncertainty information, as one would believe. Myself? I recently spent some time trying to understand why these deep learning models work so well \u2013 trying to relate them to new research from the last couple of years. I was quite surprised to see how close these were to my beloved Gaussian processes. I was even more surprised to see that we can get uncertainty information from these deep learning models for free \u2013 without changing a thing.",

Conceptually, it is useful to view the multilevel regression model as a\r\nhierarchical system of regression equations.

These tutorials will show the user how to use both the lme4 package in R to fit linear and nonlinear mixed effect models, and to use rstan to fit fully Bayesian multilevel models.

As the old saying goes: \u201cThe unexamined plot is not worth exporting to a PNG.\u201d \n\nThus, I\u2019m using my discovery of Altair as an opportunity to step back \u2014 to investigate how Python\u2019s statistical visualization options hang together.

    "extended": "When we discuss prediction models, prediction errors can be decomposed into two main subcomponents we care about: error due to \"bias\" and error due to \"variance\". There is a tradeoff between a model's ability to minimize bias and variance. Understanding these two types of error can help us diagnose model results and avoid the mistake of over- or under-fitting.",
