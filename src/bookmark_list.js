I\u2019ve actually been thinking about it for years. I\u2019ve always been searching for the optimal way to sort through the bajillion things I have to do and remain productive.\r\n\r\nThis all started when, as a programmer, I realized that I had the power to automate the tasks that I found repetitive in my digital life. I would write scripts, for example, to do things like organize my photos, clean up my music library, and back up my data. Over the years, I\u2019ve developed my own homegrown approach to task management, which has included a couple of attempts at writing a command-line tool to manage my tasks in a way that\u2019s in line with my approach. Then, recently, I discovered that there is already a robust command-line tool that does exactly what I need.\r\n\r\nThat tool is Taskwarrior. But before I get into it, here\u2019s a brief dive into the journey that led me to using it.","meta":"1cd3135309f4bb47c00ae81d9449f794","hash":"5697efc80b70a3b6450a52f90e4d20c8","time":"2020-10-18T10:13:36Z","shared":"no","toread":"no","tags":"taskwarrior gtd"},

They are subject to change in three axis: the code itself, the model, and the data. Their behaviour is often complex and hard to predict, and they are harder to test, harder to explain, and harder to improve.

Maybe that's why it felt so weird playing with those deep learning models (I know, joining the party very late). You see, I spent the last several years working mostly with Gaussian processes, modelling probability distributions over functions. I'm used to uncertainty bounds for decision making, in a similar way many biologists rely on model uncertainty to analyse their data. Working with point estimates alone felt weird to me. I couldn't tell whether the new model I was playing with was making sensible predictions or just guessing at random. I'm certain you've come across this problem yourself, either analysing data or solving some tasks, where you wished you could tell whether your model is certain about its output, asking yourself \"maybe I need to use more diverse data? or perhaps change the model?\". Most deep learning tools operate in a very different setting to the probabilistic models which possess this invaluable uncertainty information, as one would believe. Myself? I recently spent some time trying to understand why these deep learning models work so well \u2013 trying to relate them to new research from the last couple of years. I was quite surprised to see how close these were to my beloved Gaussian processes. I was even more surprised to see that we can get uncertainty information from these deep learning models for free \u2013 without changing a thing.","meta":"022b80de168e2e3432096b3d0360fea0","hash":"a6318a7b0269dcae9583cef55398c2d1","time":"2017-01-02T14:31:52Z","shared":"no","toread":"no","tags":"deep-learning uncertainty probability drop-out gaussian-processes math ann"},

They all assume that there is a hierarchical data set, with one single outcome\r\nor response variable that is measured at the lowest level, and explanatory variables at\r\nall existing levels. Conceptually, it is useful to view the multilevel regression model as a\r\nhierarchical system of regression equations. In this chapter, I will explain the multilevel\r\nregression  model  for  two-level  data,  and  also  give  an  example  of  three-level  data.\r\nRegression models with more than two levels are also used in later chapters.","meta":"dcecf1eebcd9e27d1b5c8e66a04c4b7c","hash":"bf2fab48e4f4ddba6b778e79ab07a611","time":"2016-10-27T11:18:45Z","shared":"no","toread":"no","tags":"multilevel hierarchical model linear mixed-effects"},

These tutorials will show the user how to use both the lme4 package in R to fit linear and nonlinear mixed effect models, and to use rstan to fit fully Bayesian multilevel models.
